<section name="What to download?">
<p>
In the directory
<a href="http://downloads.apache.org/commons/daemon/binaries/">binaries</a>
you will find subdirectories containing archives
corresponding to your operating system. Only the Windows builds are provided as a zip file.

<section name="How do I get the executable?">
<subsection name="procrun">
<p>
The Windows archive (e.g. commons-daemon-x.y.z-bin-windows.zip) contains 2 different executables:
</p>
<ul>
<li>prunsrv.exe - service application for running applications as services.</li>
<li>prunmgr.exe - the GUI manager application used to monitor and configure installed services.</li>
</ul>
<p>
There is only one <code>prunmgr.exe</code> application for all architectures.
The <code>prunsrv.exe</code> executable is available in 2 different versions for different architectures.
The version in the top-level directory is for 32-bit (x86) architectures.
The lower level directories are for AMD/EMT 64-bit systems. Itanium is no longer supported.
</p>
<p>
The Windows application <code>prunsrv.exe</code> is used to install an application as a service.
Once installed, <code>prunmgr.exe</code> can be used to monitor and reconfigure the service.
(see <a href="procrun.html">procrun</a> for more information).
The Windows binary zip archive should be unpacked into the location from which you wish to run it, for example:
<code>%ProgramFiles%\Apache Commons Daemon</code>
