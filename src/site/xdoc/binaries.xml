<section name="What to download?">
<p>
In the directory
<a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/commons/daemon/binaries/">binaries</a>
you will find subdirectories containing archives
corresponding to your operating system. If your machine is not in the list,
please mail us and we will try to make it available, or you can try to build it on your own.
The non-Windows files are compressed tar files. They are named <code>commons-daemon-m.n.p-bin-os-hw.tar.gz</code>.
For example: In the directory <code>linux</code> we have <code>commons-daemon-1.1.0-bin-linux-i686.tar.gz</code>
That is a file suitable for a Linux system running on Intel hardware.
Windows builds are provided as a zip file.
</p>

<section name="How do I get the executable?">
<subsection name="jsvc">
<p>
Do the following:
<ul>
  <li>Find the tar.gz file corresponding to your configuration.</li>
  <li>Download it.</li>
  <li>Uncompress the tar file and extract the contents (better with gnu tar).
  There should be an executable file called <code>jsvc</code> and some text files</li>
  <li>Copy the executable to the location where you want to run it.</li>
  <li>Write a suitable shell script
     (see in <code>src/samples</code> and <code>src/native/unix/native/Tomcat.sh</code>)
     to get your Java application started as a daemon.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<subsection name="procrun">
<p>
The Windows archive (e.g. commons-daemon-1.1.0-bin-windows.zip) contains 2 different executables:
<ul>
<li>prunsrv.exe - service application for running applications as services.</li>
<li>prunmgr.exe - the GUI manager application used to monitor and configure installed services.</li>
</ul>
There is only one <code>prunmgr.exe</code> application for all architectures.
The <code>prunsrv.exe</code> executable is available in 3 different versions for different architectures.
The version in the top-level directory is for 32-bit (x86) architectures.
The lower level directories are for 64-bit systems:
<ul>
<li>amd64 - AMD 64-bit</li>
<li>ia64 - Intel 64-bit</li>
</ul>
The Windows application <code>prunsrv.exe</code> is used to install an application as a service.
Once installed, <code>prunmgr.exe</code> can be used to monitor and reconfigure the service.
(see <a href="procrun.html">procrun</a> for more information).
The Windows binary zip archive should be unpacked into the location from which you wish to run it, for example:
<code>%ProgramFiles%\Apache Commons Daemon</code>
