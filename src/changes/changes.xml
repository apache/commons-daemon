  This file is used by the maven-changes-plugin to generate the release notes.
  Useful ways of finding items to add to this file are:

  1. Add items when you fix a bug or add a feature (this makes the
  release process easy :-).

  2. Do a JIRA search for tickets closed since the previous release.

  3. Use the report generated by the maven-changelog-plugin to see all
  SVN commits. Set the project.properties' maven.changelog.range
  property to the number of days since the last release.


  The <action> type attribute can be add,update,fix,remove.
