To build the service libraries and binary under an UNIX operating
system you will need:

  An ANSI-C compliant compiler (GCC is good)
  GNU AutoConf
  A Java Platform 2 compliant SDK

First of all you need to build the "configure" program with:

   sh support/buildconf.sh
(Note it is possible to replace sh by any compatible shell like bash, ksh).

Once the configure script is generated, run it (remember to specify
either the --with-java=<dir> parameter or set the JAVA_HOME environment
to point to your JDK installation. For example:

  ./configure --with-java=/usr/java

or

  JAVA_HOME=/usr/java
  export JAVA_HOME
  ./configure

If your operating system is supported, configure will go thru cleanly,
otherwise it will report an error (please send us the details of your
OS/JDK, or a patch against the sources). To build the binaries and
libraries simply do:

  make

This will generate the file:  ./jsvc.
It should be straightforward from here on. To check the allowed parameters
for the jsvc binary simply do

  ./native/jsvc -help

and then, to check a simple service do

  ./native/jsvc -cp ./java/service.jar org.apache.service.support.SimpleService

and telnet to localhost on port 1200. For a less simple example login as root
and add the "-user nobody" after the classpath, and "100" after the class name.
This will start the same daemon but running as user "nobody" and bound to your
protected port 100 (again, try telnet to localhost but to port 100 this time).

For other information, the source code is quite readable, and I'm working on
some documentation.

Have fun...
