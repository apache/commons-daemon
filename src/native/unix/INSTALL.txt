To build the service libraries and binary under an UNIX operating
system you will need:

  An ANSI-C compliant compiler (GCC is good)
  A Java Platform 2 compliant SDK
  GNU AutoConf (when building for SVN).

When building from SVN sources you need to build the "configure" program with:

   sh support/buildconf.sh
(Note it is possible to replace sh by any compatible shell like bash, ksh).

Once the configure script is generated, run it (remember to specify
either the --with-java=<dir> parameter or set the JAVA_HOME environment
to point to your JDK installation. For example:

  ./configure --with-java=/usr/java

or

  JAVA_HOME=/usr/java
  export JAVA_HOME
  ./configure

or (when using gcj (use fastjar for jar))
  JAVAC=gcj; export JAVAC
  JAVACFLAGS=-c; export JAVACFLAGS
  ./configure

Note: On Mac OS X <dir> is /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home.

If your operating system is supported, configure will go thru cleanly,
otherwise it will report an error (please send us the details of your
OS/JDK, or a patch against the sources). To build the binaries and
libraries simply do:

  make

This will generate the file:  ./jsvc.
It should be straightforward from here on. To check the allowed parameters
for the jsvc binary simply do

  ./native/jsvc -help

Note: On Linux the module capabilities should be loaded, when using -user root
make sure you REALLY understand what capabilities does (for example for
files access: the downgraded root may not be able to read some files!).

Making 64-bit binaries

To be able to build the 64-binaries for supported platforms enter the
specific parameters before calling configure

   export CFLAGS=-m64
   export LDFLAGS=-m64
   ./configure
   make

Making Universal binaries

Some platforms like Mac OSX allow universal or fat binaries that allow
both 32 and 64 binaries inside the same executable. To be able to build
the fat binaries enter the specific parameters before calling configure

   export CFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64"
   export LDFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64"
   ./configure
   make
