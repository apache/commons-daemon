To build the service utilities for windows you will need:
- MS Visual C++ (I have used version 5.0).
- CYGWIN to build the jsvc.exe.
- A Java Platform 2 compliant SDK to run the service.

Structure of the utilies:
- bin: exe files.
- executables/vdmoniadm: project files for the desktop program.
- executables/vdmonisvc: project files for the sevice wrapper.
- lib: contains the common include file.
- moni: contains sources of the vdmoniadm and vdmonisvc.
- service: contains the sources and the project for the test installer.
- signals: contains the kill() emulation logic.
- supcalls_nt: contains the environment emulation logic.

How to use it:
1 - Build the jsvc.exe (See jakarta-tomcat-4.0/service).
  It produces:
  - service.jar
  - jsvc.exe

2- Create the following directories:
  c:\home\jakarta\bin
  c:\home\jakarta\lib

3 - Copy
  From jakarta-tomcat-4.0/service:
  service.jar to lib
  jsvc.exe to bin
  From winnt:
  INSTSVC.exe to bin
  vdmoniadm.exe to bin
  vdmonisvc to bin.

4 - In a MSDOS windows run INSTSVC
  It creates all informations to start the service.
    The service is not started automaticly use control_panel+service and
    and make it automatic after testing it starts and stops correctly.

  It creates the registry values needed for the environment to start jsvc.exe
    JAKARTA_HOME
    CYGWIN (You have to set it to your cygwin directory home).
    JAVA_HOME (You have to set it to your JAVA_HOME directory).
    HOSTNAME (not yet used)
    HOSTPORT (not yet used)
  I use regedit to modify these values.

5 - Using the explorer go to profiles/allusers/program/startup and add a link
  to vdmoniadm.exe.

6 - Reboot the machine and logon.
  You should see a "nice" icon in the System Task-bar indicating that the 
  Java service is running. A right click on the icon calls a small menu.
  Restart: (not yet implemented).
  Configure: (not yet implemented).
  Stop: Stops the java service.

It is still a work in progress and blabla...

Have fun...
