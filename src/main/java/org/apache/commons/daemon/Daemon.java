     *   constructor.

     *   Under certain operating systems (typically Unix based operating
     *   systems) and if the native invocation framework is configured to do
     *   so, this method might be called with <i>super-user</i> privileges.

     *   instances within the scope of this method, and perform all operations
     *   requiring <i>super-user</i> privileges in the underlying operating
     *   system.

     *   must not start the actual operation of the <code>Daemon</code> (such
     *   as starting threads calling the <code>ServerSocket.accept()</code>
     *   method) as this would impose some serious security hazards. The
     *   start of operation must be performed in the <code>start()</code>
     *   method.

     * rather than a stack trace.
     * @throws Exception Any exception preventing a successful
